# Profile-Generator
Use Node to generate a pdf of user data, given inputs of a GitHub user name and preferred color.

## Functionality
This project is un from Node on the command line. In VS Code you may open the terminal (Ctrl+\`), navigate to the main folder, and run index.js ("node index.js").
The tool will prompt for a username and color, and once provided, will fire off an API call to GitHub to pull the user data. It then organizes this data and generates a new index2.html file from a template index.html file and the response from GitHub. Finally, it generates a new pdf from the index2.html document.
